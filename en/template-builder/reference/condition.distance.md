# @yandex-toloka/condition.distance

This component checks whether the sent coordinates match the ones that you specified.

For example, you want a Toloker to take a photo of a specific place. The `condition.distance` component checks whether the photo was taken at the location that you specified.

The device coordinates are sent using the [data.location](data.location.md) component. You can use it without `condition.distance` if you need to read a Toloker's device coordinates without comparing them to the specified ones.
